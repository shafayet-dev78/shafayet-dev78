![I am a Full Stack Web Developer & Graphic Designer]

After passing B.Com in 2000, I joined a business organization called 'Fair Business Center', Mohakhali, Dhaka as a Computer Operator. While there, I passed the practical test by applying for a job as an IT officer in a reputed company in Bangladesh.

I joined Fareast Islamic Life Insurance Company on January 17, 2004 as a Junior Officer (IT). First, after 6 (six) months of service at the head office of the company, posting was done at the Brahmanbaria zonal office of the company. Gradually I was transferred to the company's Bancharampur Service Center and Comilla Divisional Office.

I was promoted to the rank of Officer (IT), Senior Officer (IT), Executive Officer (IT) and Senior Executive Officer (IT) in the company. Finally, in February 2021, I was fired from the company.

During my employment I have taken courses in Advanced Graphics Design and Full Stock Web Development.

My future plan is to become a successful freelancer and try my best to create employment opportunities for the educated unemployed youth of the country. To that end, I am planning to set up an IT firm. Looking forward to the support of all the benefactors.

Thanks for being by my side.

Regards

Md. Shafayet Hossain
